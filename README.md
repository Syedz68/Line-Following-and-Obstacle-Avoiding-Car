# Line Following and Obstacle Avoiding Car

Built a semi autonomous car using Arduino Uno R3. The key feature of this car is it follows line using IR sensors.

// Line Following

Two IR sensors were used in the front to detect whether there is a line or not. If it finds line, the car moves following the line.

// Obstacle Avoiding

Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) was used in case of object detecting. It was attached to a servo motor. Whenever a obstacle comes in front of the car, it stops and checks for the both sides. If there is obstacle in the right as well, it goes from the left side ro aboid the obstacles and vice versa.
